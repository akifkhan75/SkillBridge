# Fixli — Implementation Audit & Phase-wise Build Plan

> Status: **audit + plan only; nothing in this document has been implemented.**
> Audited: 2026-10-07, branch `fix-mobile-app`, all of `apps/` and `packages/`, against docs 00–23.
> Supersedes the "current-state inventory" in `22_UX_UI_AUDIT_AND_REDESIGN_PLAN.md` §12, which is out of date.
> Read with `19_AGENT_ENGINEERING_RULES.md` (still binding) and `21_PRODUCTION_AUDIT_HARDENING.md` (severity scale).

## Part A — Audit

### A.1 Verdict

The repository is a **UI prototype on top of an insecure CRUD API**. The design system, light/dark theming and the new tab structure from doc 22 exist, but the core marketplace loop (request → match → book → work → pay → review) does not work end to end. Almost every screen after "create a request" renders hard-coded data with "DEV TOOLS" buttons to fake state changes. The API has twelve P0 issues (data leaks, mass assignment, unauthenticated WebSocket identity).

**Production readiness (doc 21 §31): ≈ 16 / 115 (14 %) — not production ready.**

### A.2 Things to know first

| # | Issue | Impact |
|---|-------|--------|
| K1 | Root `.gitignore` "Legacy files" block ignores every `App.tsx`, `index.tsx`, `app.json`, `babel.config.js`. Untracked today: `apps/mobile/app.json`, `apps/mobile/app/index.tsx`, `apps/mobile/app/(customer)/(home)/index.tsx`, `apps/mobile/babel.config.js`, `apps/admin/src/App.tsx`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx`. | A fresh clone cannot build mobile, admin or web. |
| K2 | `apps/mobile/tsconfig.json` sets `moduleResolution: node`, which conflicts with `expo/tsconfig.base` (`customConditions`). `tsc` aborts on the config and checks nothing. With it fixed there are **32 type errors** (e.g. `theme.colors.onPrimary` used 9× but not defined). | Type safety is currently fictional for mobile. |
| K3 | Brand conflict: doc 23 renames the product to **Triply**; `src/i18n/index.ts` `app.name` and `apps/web` say Triply; docs 00–22, `app.json`, logos and splash say **Fixli**. | Owner decision needed (see B.1). |
| K4 | `Prolivo_Product_Documentation.zip` (repo root, untracked) is an older copy of docs 00–20 under a previous name. | Do not use as a source. |
| K5 | API tests: 85 tests, **18 failing** (jobs, auth, workers, ai suites). Some passing tests assert insecure behaviour (e.g. "should not filter by customerId for worker users"). Mobile: 2 of 6 suites fail (`ReactCurrentOwner`, test-renderer/React 19 mismatch). No CI (`.github/` absent). | No safety net for any of the work below. |
| K6 | Only one Prisma migration exists (8 tables); the schema has 22 models (added via `db push`). `apps/api/Dockerfile` runs `prisma migrate deploy` and uses `npm ci` inside a pnpm workspace with `workspace:*`. | Production DB would be missing most tables; Docker build fails. |

### A.3 P0 findings (must fix before anything ships)

| ID | Finding | Evidence |
|----|---------|----------|
| S1 | `GET /api/users` is unauthenticated and returns every user's name, email and role. | `apps/api/src/users/users.controller.ts:13` |
| S2 | WebSocket identity comes from `?userId=` in the handshake query. Anyone can impersonate any user, receive their `newMessage` events, send as them, spoof `locationUpdate`. CORS `*`. | `apps/api/src/chat/gateways/chat.gateway.ts:17,28,46` |
| S3 | Emergency jobs are broadcast with `server.emit('emergencyAlert', job)` to **every** connected socket, including customer email, description and location. | `apps/api/src/jobs/jobs.service.ts:33` |
| S4 | `PATCH/PUT /job-requests/:id` writes `dto as any`: customers can set `status`, `paymentAmount`, `assignedWorkerId`; workers can self-assign any open job and set `COMPLETED`. No state machine. Two workers can "accept" the same job (no conditional update). | `jobs.service.ts:96-118` |
| S5 | Workers see **all** jobs of all customers in `GET /job-requests` and any unassigned job's customer email in `GET /job-requests/:id`. | `jobs.service.ts:42-47, 66-70` |
| S6 | `@Body() data: any` bypasses `ValidationPipe` in quotes, change-orders, addresses, reviews, properties, recurring-jobs → mass assignment (e.g. worker creates a quote with `status: 'APPROVED'`; change orders on jobs nobody is assigned to). | `quotes.service.ts:20`, `change-orders.service.ts:20`, `addresses.service.ts:15`, `properties.service.ts:9` |
| S7 | IDOR: `GET /quotes/job/:id`, `GET /change-orders/job/:id`, `GET /disputes/:id` (read); `POST /properties/:id/assets`, `POST /properties/assets/:id/warranties` (write); all of `/recurring-jobs/*` (read/write). | respective controllers |
| S8 | Reviews: anyone can review anyone, no completed-job requirement, `rating` unbounded → one review can set any worker's average to any number. | `reviews.service.ts` |
| S9 | Mobile login returns a **logged-in mock user on any error**, including wrong password; any `@example.com` email is auto-logged-in with `mock-token`. OTP screen: `0000` → customer, `1111` → worker, anything else → role picker that logs in as a demo account. | `apps/mobile/src/store/authSlice.ts:29-61`, `app/(auth)/otp.tsx:31-53` |
| S10 | Rate limiting configured but inactive: `ThrottlerGuard` is never registered as `APP_GUARD`. Only per-account lockout exists, which lets anyone lock out a known account. | `apps/api/src/app.module.ts` |
| S11 | `GET /workers`, `GET /workers/:id` are public and return worker email and `homeAddress`. | `workers.service.ts:20-40` |
| S12 | Disputes can be opened on any job by any user (no participant check). | `disputes.service.ts:8` |

**P1 (high):** 7-day JWT, no refresh/logout/revocation · default JWT secret in `docker-compose.yml` · 50 MB JSON body limit with base64 media · Swagger public · `HttpExceptionFilter` never registered · AI prompts interpolate raw user text (prompt injection) · AI safety screen **fails open** (`isSafe: true` on error) · AI error strings returned as user content ("Failed to transcribe audio.") · no AI rate limit · no audit log · customer GPS watched continuously from login (`useCustomerLocationTracker` mounted globally in `app/_layout.tsx`) · worker Account shows "✓ Verified Professional" for everyone (doc 09 violation) · hard-coded LAN IP `192.168.100.66` fallback in `services/api.ts:15`, `services/socket.ts:8` · `UpdateWorkerDto.skills` is not a DB column (Prisma error on write) · `CreateJobDto` has no `serviceId`, so `forbidNonWhitelisted` rejects requests that send one.

### A.4 Placeholder / fake data inventory (every instance must go)

| `api/prisma/seed.ts` | Demo users with `password123` (allowed **only** as a dev-only seed, see B.2) |

### A.5 New requirements from the owner (2026-10-07) — gap analysis

| # | Requirement | Current state | Gap |
|---|-------------|---------------|-----|
| R1 | **No placeholder data; all data real from DB** | See A.4: ~25 placeholder sites; categories from constants; admin always dummy | Every screen must load from the API, show loading/empty/error states, and never fall back to fake data. Dev seed data only in dev DB. |
| R2 | **All screens fully functional** | Only Login (email) and Request (create job) touch the API; every other screen is static or local-state | Every button must perform a real, server-validated action (§C.2 screen matrix). |
| R3 | **Realtime notifications and updates** | Socket.IO exists but unauthenticated; only `newMessage`, `locationUpdate`, `emergencyAlert` (leaky broadcast). No push, no notification table/centre, no job-status events | Authenticated socket, room model, event catalog, persisted notifications, Expo push, in-app notification centre, live badge counts, reconnect backfill (§C.3). |
| R4 | **Realtime chat** | REST + socket send exist; no way to **create** a conversation; no pagination; no read receipts UI; both chat screens are placeholders | Job-scoped conversations auto-created on booking, chat list + thread screens, live delivery, typing, read receipts, image messages, unread counts, push when offline. |
| R5 | **Proper user profiles for workers and customers** | User has name/email/photo only; Worker has loose strings (`availability`, `hourlyRateRange`, `homeAddress`); no customer profile editing; no public worker profile screen | Structured customer profile and worker profile (§C.4 data model), edit screens, photo upload, public worker profile with real stats/reviews/portfolio, verification status. |
| R6 | **Phone number + password login for workers and customers** | Email + password only; `User.email` required & unique; no `phone` column | `User.phone` (E.164, unique) becomes the login identifier; email optional. Admin keeps email login. **Supersedes doc 22 D-row "no password" (U1, §6.3 A)** — see B.1 D8. |
| R7 | **Proper signups for customers and workers** | `POST /auth/signup` with email; no mobile signup screen exists at all now | Separate, guided signup flows for each role (§C.5), phone verification, worker onboarding to "pending review". |
| R8 | **Phone input masked by current country** | No phone field anywhere; `react-native-masked-text` installed but unused (unmaintained) | Country detection + `libphonenumber-js` as-you-type formatting, country picker, E.164 storage, identical validation on client and server (§C.6). |
| R9 | (implied by R1–R2) **Admin needs real data** | Admin portal has no login and shows dummy data | Admin auth + RBAC and real pages, so verification/disputes actually work (otherwise workers can never be approved). |

## Part B — Decisions

### B.1 Decisions

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|----------|--------|
| D8 | **Login = phone number + password** for customers and workers (owner, 2026-10-07). Overrides doc 22 U1 / §6.3 A ("no password"). Admin staff keep email + password + MFA. | Decided |
| D9 | **Phone ownership is verified once at signup with a one-time code (SMS, WhatsApp where configured), and again for password reset.** Without it anyone can register someone else's number. Login itself does not need a code. | Recommended — owner to confirm |
| D10 | **No placeholder data in app code.** Missing data shows a real empty state. Demo data exists only in a dev-only seed script and a dev DB; release builds contain no demo accounts or DEV TOOLS. | Decided (R1) |
| D11 | Brand: **Fixli** (logos, app.json, docs 00–22) vs **Triply** (doc 23). This plan assumes **Fixli** until the owner says otherwise; the name lives in one config key so a switch is a one-line change. | **Open — owner** |
| D12 | Launch scope remains **Pakistan first** (doc 22 §11.5); every country-specific value comes from country config, never code. | Decided (doc 22) |
| D13 | Payments at launch: **cash on completion** + commission ledger (doc 22 §11.8). Card/wallet behind a provider adapter in a later phase, after legal item L5. | Decided (doc 22) |

### B.2 Rules that apply to every phase

- Every screen: loading, empty, error-with-retry, offline states; light/dark; LTR/RTL; translated strings; accessibility labels.
- Every endpoint: DTO class (never `any`), ownership check in the query, role guard, pagination for lists, standard error envelope, audit entry if sensitive.
- Every state change goes through a server-side state machine and emits a realtime event.
- Every money value: integer minor units + ISO currency from country config.
- A phase is **done** only when its exit criteria pass on a real device against a real API and DB, with tests and CI green.

## Part C — Target specification

### C.1 Target navigation

```
Auth:      Welcome/Language → Login | Sign up (choose role)
           Customer sign-up: Phone → Code → Name + Password → (Photo) → Home
           Worker sign-up:   Phone → Code → Name + Password → Skills → Area → Hours → ID docs → Selfie → Pending review
           Forgot password:  Phone → Code → New password
Customer tabs: Home | My Jobs | Messages | Account      (+ Notifications from bell)
Worker tabs:   Today | Jobs | Messages | Earnings | Account
```

(Doc 22 proposed 3/4 tabs with chat inside the job; R4 asks for real-time chat as a feature, so Messages is a tab that lists job conversations. Each job screen also links to its conversation.)

### C.2 Screen matrix (every screen, its data, actions and live updates)

| **Admin (web)** | `/admin/v1/*` | see Phase 11 | `admin.*` |

### C.3 Realtime & notification design

**Transport:** Socket.IO namespace `/rt`. Client sends `auth: { token }` (access JWT) in the handshake; server verifies, loads the user, rejects otherwise; token refresh → reconnect. No user IDs accepted from clients.

**Rooms:** `user:{id}` (joined automatically), `job:{id}` (server joins participants only), `conversation:{id}` (participants only), `admin:{role}`.

**Event envelope:** `{ id, type, version, occurredAt, data }`. `id` is the `job_events`/`notifications` row ID so clients can de-duplicate.

**Event catalog:**

| Event | Room | Trigger |
|-------|------|---------|
| `job.request` | `user:{workerId}` for each matched worker | job submitted / re-matched |
| `offer.created` / `offer.withdrawn` / `offer.expired` | `job:{id}` | worker sends price / expiry job |
| `offer.accepted` | `user:{workerId}` | customer chooses |
| `job.status_changed` | `job:{id}` + both `user:` rooms | any state-machine transition |
| `worker.location` | `job:{id}` (customer only) | only in `EN_ROUTE`, throttled ≥ 5 s, stops on `ARRIVED` |
| `change_order.requested` / `change_order.decided` | `job:{id}` | |
| `payment.recorded` | `job:{id}` | cash marked / confirmed |
| `message.created` / `message.read` / `typing` | `conversation:{id}` | |
| `notification.created` | `user:{id}` | any persisted notification |
| `verification.updated` | `user:{workerId}` | admin decision |
| `dispute.updated` | parties' `user:` rooms | |

**Persistence & push:** every user-relevant event also writes a `notifications` row (type, payload, readAt) and, if the user has no active socket or the app is backgrounded, sends an **Expo push** (`expo-notifications`; token stored per session/device). Channels: booking, job, message, payment, safety, marketing (marketing opt-in only). De-duplication by `(eventId, recipient, channel)`.

**Client:** a single `RealtimeProvider` dispatches events into Redux (RTK Query cache invalidation or slice updates). On reconnect: `GET /sync?since=<lastEventAt>` to backfill missed events. Badge counts (unread messages, unread notifications) are server-computed.

**Scale:** Socket.IO Redis adapter so multiple API instances share rooms (Redis also used for rate limits and presence).

### C.4 Data model changes (Prisma; each change is a migration)

**Identity**
- `User`: add `phone` (E.164, **unique**, required for customer/worker), `phoneVerifiedAt`, `countryCode` (ISO-3166), `locale`, `timezone`, `status` (ACTIVE / SUSPENDED / DELETED), `lastLoginAt`; `email` becomes optional (still unique when present; required for admin); `profileImageUrl` → `avatarKey` (object-storage key). Remove picsum defaults.
- `Session`: `id, userId, deviceId, deviceName, platform, pushToken, refreshTokenHash, createdAt, lastUsedAt, expiresAt, revokedAt`.
- `PhoneVerification`: `id, phone, purpose (SIGNUP|RESET|CHANGE), codeHash, attempts, expiresAt, consumedAt, ip`.
- `CountryConfig`: per doc 22 §11.3a (currency + exponent, dial code, phone rules, OTP channels, locales, payment methods, emergency numbers, ID documents, week, commission settings) — versioned JSON validated by a zod schema in `packages/shared`.

**Customer**
- `CustomerProfile`: `userId, preferredLanguage, preferredWorkerGender?, notificationPrefs (json), defaultAddressId?`.
- `Address`: add `countryCode`, `area`, `landmark`, `buildingDetail`, `geog geography(Point,4326)`, `precision`; make `postalCode` optional (not universal).
- `TrustedContact`: `id, userId, name, phone, relationship, verifiedAt`.
- `FavoriteProfessional`: `customerId, professionalId`.

**Worker** (rename `Worker` → `Professional` or keep name; fields below)
- Add: `displayName`, `businessName?`, `gender?`, `hidePhotoUntilBooked`, `bio`, `yearsExperience`, `languages[]`, `serviceCenter geography(Point)`, `serviceRadiusKm`, `pricingModel` (FIXED | HOURLY | CALLOUT_PLUS_QUOTE | QUOTE), `callOutFee` (minor units), `hourlyRate` (minor units), `currency`, `onlineAt`, stats (`jobsCompleted`, `ratingAvg`, `ratingCount`, `responseRate`, `onTimeRate`, `cancellationRate`) recomputed by jobs, not editable.
- Remove free-text `availability`, `hourlyRateRange`, `homeAddress`, `licenseDetails`.
- `ProfessionalService`: `professionalId, serviceId, skillLevel, yearsExperience, active`.
- `WorkingHours`: `professionalId, weekday, start, end, timezone`.
- `PortfolioItem`: `id, professionalId, title, mediaKeys[], serviceId?, createdAt`.
- `VerificationCase`: `id, professionalId, type (ID|SELFIE|TRADE_LICENSE|INSURANCE|REFERENCE), status (SUBMITTED|IN_REVIEW|APPROVED|REJECTED|EXPIRED|NEEDS_INFO), documentKeys[], reviewerId, reviewedAt, expiresAt, reason, metadata`. Badges derive from approved cases only.

**Catalog**
- `ServiceCategory`: add `code`, `parentId`, `riskLevel`, `iconKey`, `sortOrder`; translations table `CatalogTranslation(entity, entityId, locale, name, description)`.
- `Service`: add `code`, `pricingModel`, `priceBandMin/Max` per country (`ServicePrice(serviceId, countryCode, city?, min, max, currency)`).
- `ServiceIssue`: common problem chips per service (doc 22 §5.1 step 2).
- `ServiceQuestion` (doc 06).

**Jobs & marketplace**
- `JobRequest` → `Job`: `status` per state machine below, `serviceId` (required), `issueIds[]`, `title` (generated), `description`, `urgency` enum, `isEmergency`, `addressId`, `geog`, `scheduledFrom/To`, `whenOption`, `currency`, `estimateMin/Max`, `preferredWorkerGender?`, `cancelReason`, timestamps per phase. Remove string `location`, `requestedDate`, `priceEstimate`, `customerName`, `paymentAmount`.
- `JobMedia`: `id, jobId, kind (PHOTO|VIDEO|AUDIO), phase (REQUEST|BEFORE|AFTER|CHANGE_ORDER|DISPUTE), storageKey, thumbKey, mime, size, uploadedBy`.
- `JobAiAnalysis`: `jobId, provider, model, promptVersion, schemaVersion, output, confidence, safetyFlags, latencyMs, validationOk`.
- `JobMatch`: `jobId, professionalId, score, distanceM, reasons, notifiedAt, declinedAt`.
- `Offer` (replaces `Quote`): `id, jobId, professionalId, amount, currency, etaMinutes, note, voiceKey?, status (PENDING|ACCEPTED|REJECTED|WITHDRAWN|EXPIRED), expiresAt`; unique `(jobId, professionalId)` while pending.
- `Booking`: `id, jobId (unique), professionalId, offerId, agreedAmount, status, acceptedAt, enRouteAt, arrivedAt, startedAt, completedAt, confirmedAt, cancelledAt, cancelledBy, cancelReason`. Partial unique index to stop double-booking.
- `ChangeOrder`: add `bookingId`, `items (json)`, `oldTotal`, `newTotal`, `reason`, `mediaKeys`, `decidedAt`, `decidedBy`.
- `JobEvent`: `id, jobId, actorId, type, from, to, payload, createdAt` (timeline + realtime source).

**Money**
- `Payment`: `id, bookingId, method (CASH|CARD|WALLET), amount, currency, status (PENDING|MARKED_BY_WORKER|CONFIRMED|DISPUTED|CAPTURED|REFUNDED), provider?, providerRef? (unique), idempotencyKey (unique), timestamps`.
- `LedgerEntry` (immutable): `id, professionalId, bookingId?, type (COMMISSION_OWED|COMMISSION_SETTLED|PAYOUT|ADJUSTMENT|REFUND), amount (signed minor units), currency, balanceAfter, createdAt, createdBy`.

- `Notification`: `id, userId, type, title, body, data, eventId, channel, sentAt, readAt`; unique `(eventId, userId, channel)`.

**Trust, safety, ops**
- `Review`: add `jobId/bookingId` (required), `revieweeRole`, unique `(bookingId, reviewerId)`, `rating` 1–5 check, `tags[]`, `status`.
- `Dispute`: add `bookingId`, `category` enum, `amountHeld`, `evidenceKeys[]`, `status` enum, `resolvedBy`, `resolvedAt`.

- `FeatureFlag`: `key, enabled, rules`.

**Infra:** enable PostGIS extension; GiST indexes on `geog`; indexes on all FKs and `(status, createdAt)`.

### C.5 Sign-up and login flows (R6, R7)

**Login (both roles)**
1. Country chip (pre-selected, §C.6) + masked phone field + password field (show/hide toggle).
2. `POST /auth/login { phone (E.164), password, deviceId }` → `{ accessToken (15 min), refreshToken (30 d, rotated), user }`. Tokens in `expo-secure-store`.
3. Errors: one generic message "Phone number or password is wrong" (no enumeration); after 5 failures: 15 min cooldown **per phone + IP pair**, plus global IP throttle; "Forgot password?" link always visible.
4. App start: `restoreSession` → `POST /auth/refresh` → `GET /me`; splash stays until resolved (doc 23 §B.2).
5. Role routing comes from the server `user.role`, never from client input.

**Customer sign-up**
1. Role: "I need a service".
2. Phone (masked) → code sent (`POST /auth/phone/start {phone, purpose: SIGNUP}`; WhatsApp or SMS per country config; 60 s resend cooldown; 5 attempts; 10 min expiry; `oneTimeCode` autofill) → `POST /auth/phone/verify` returns a short-lived `signupToken`.
3. Name + password (min 8 characters, strength hint, plain-language rules) → `POST /auth/signup {signupToken, name, password, role: CUSTOMER, locale}`.
4. Optional photo (camera/gallery → presigned upload). Skip allowed.
5. Language confirmed → Home. Location permission is asked **only** at the request flow's "Where?" step, with an explainer.

**Worker sign-up** (account works immediately; accepting jobs needs approval)
1. Role: "I fix things".
2. Phone + code (as above).
3. Name + password → account created with `role: WORKER`, `Professional.status: ONBOARDING`.
4. "What do you fix?" multi-select tiles from catalog (≥ 1).
5. "Where do you work?" map pin + radius chips (3 / 5 / 10 km).
6. Working hours presets (Mornings / Full day / Evenings / Weekends too) + customise.
7. Pricing model + call-out fee / hourly rate (AmountField, currency from country config).
8. ID document (type from country config, e.g. CNIC) front/back photos + selfie → `VerificationCase` rows → status `PENDING_REVIEW`.
9. Done screen: "We're checking your documents" + progress meter; Today shows the verification card until approved; Online toggle disabled until approved. Each step is resumable (server stores onboarding progress).

**Password reset:** phone → code (`purpose: RESET`) → new password → all other sessions revoked.

**Account & sessions:** change password (requires current), list/revoke devices, change phone (code to the new number), delete account (store requirement; soft-delete + anonymise per retention policy).

### C.6 Country-aware phone masking (R8)

- **Library:** `libphonenumber-js` (metadata "mobile" subset) in `packages/shared` so client and server use the same parse/validate; remove `react-native-masked-text`.
- **Country detection order:** (1) last used country stored on device; (2) `expo-localization` `getLocales()[0].regionCode`; (3) `GET /config/geo` (server IP lookup); (4) country config default (PK). The detected country is pre-selected but always changeable via a searchable picker (flag + native name + dial code), limited to **enabled** launch countries from config.
- **`PhoneField` component:** shows the dial code as a fixed prefix; formats as the user types with `AsYouType(country)` (e.g. PK `0300 1234567` → `300 1234567` with `+92`); accepts pasted numbers in any format (strips spaces/dashes, detects `+` country codes and switches the country); strips a leading national `0`; numeric keypad (`keyboardType="phone-pad"`, `textContentType="telephoneNumber"`, `autoComplete="tel"`); example placeholder from metadata (`getExampleNumber`); validation on blur and on submit ("This number looks too short for Pakistan"); outputs E.164.
- **Server:** DTO validator `IsE164Phone(allowedCountries)` using the same library; numbers stored only as E.164; uniqueness enforced by DB constraint.
- **Tests:** unit tests per launch country (valid, short, long, landline vs mobile, pasted formats, leading zero, RTL locale digits → Latin).

### C.7 Job state machine (server-owned)

```
DRAFT → SUBMITTED → MATCHING → OFFERS_READY → BOOKED → EN_ROUTE → ARRIVED → IN_PROGRESS
      → AWAITING_CONFIRMATION → COMPLETED
Any pre-ARRIVED state → CANCELLED (rules by actor/time)   |   BOOKED…COMPLETED → DISPUTED
MATCHING / OFFERS_READY → EXPIRED (no offers within TTL) → can be re-submitted
```

One service (`JobStateMachine`) owns allowed transitions, required actor role, preconditions (e.g. `IN_PROGRESS → AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` requires an after photo) and side effects (JobEvent row, notification, realtime emit, ledger entry). Updates use `UPDATE … WHERE id = ? AND status = ?` (optimistic concurrency) so double accepts/completes fail cleanly. The generic `PATCH /jobs/:id` is removed; every transition is its own endpoint.

---

## Part D — Phase-wise plan

Durations are rough single-developer estimates and assume no new scope. Each phase leaves the repository buildable, tests green and the app usable.

### Phase 0 — Repo integrity & tooling (≈ 3–4 days)

**Goal:** a repo that builds from a fresh clone, type-checks for real, and has CI.

- Remove the "Legacy files" block from root `.gitignore`; commit `apps/mobile/app.json`, `app/index.tsx`, `app/(customer)/(home)/index.tsx`, `babel.config.js`, `apps/admin/src/App.tsx`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx` (review each before committing).
- Fix `apps/mobile/tsconfig.json` (drop the `module`/`moduleResolution` overrides so `expo/tsconfig.base` applies); fix all 32 type errors (add `onPrimary` token, fix `Text` weight types, `AvatarSize`, routes, `BottomSheet` props, `UserType`, `VoiceField` import).
- Fix the 2 failing mobile test suites (align `react-test-renderer`/`@testing-library/react-native` with React 19.2) and the 18 failing API tests; rewrite tests that assert insecure behaviour so they assert the secure behaviour (they will fail until Phase 1 — mark as the Phase 1 target).
- Environment: `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` required, no LAN-IP fallback; API config validated with zod on boot (fail fast); `.env.example` per app; split mobile `.env` so it holds only `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` keys (it currently duplicates the API secrets file).
- Prisma: create a baseline migration from the current schema (`migrate diff` → `0001_baseline`), delete the empty `prisma/migrations/manual_migration.sql` and fold `apps/api/manual_migration.sql` into history; `db push` forbidden outside local throwaway DBs.
- Docker: rewrite `apps/api/Dockerfile` for pnpm workspaces (`pnpm deploy --filter @fixli/api`), non-root user, healthcheck; remove the default JWT secret from `docker-compose.yml`.
- CI (GitHub Actions): install, typecheck (all packages), lint, unit tests, API e2e against a Postgres service container, Prisma migration check, `expo export` smoke build.
- Delete the stale Prolivo zip and root scratch files (`scratch_login.tsx`, `screenshot.png`) after owner OK.
- **Exit:** fresh clone → `pnpm i && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` green in CI; `docker compose up` brings up a migrated DB.

### Phase 1 — Security foundation (≈ 1 week)

**Goal:** close S1–S12 and give every later feature a safe base. No new features.

- **Guards:** global `JwtAuthGuard` (opt-out with `@Public()`), global `RolesGuard` with `@Roles()`, global `ThrottlerGuard` (Redis store) with stricter named limits for auth, codes, AI, uploads, messages.
- **Validation:** DTO classes for every body/query/param in every controller; remove all `any` bodies; `whitelist + forbidNonWhitelisted` stays; ID params validated (`ParseCuid`/UUID pipe); body limit 1 MB (media moves to object storage in Phase 3).
- **Data isolation:** every user-owned query filters by owner in the `where` clause (customer, assigned professional, conversation participant); add a test per endpoint for horizontal access (Customer A ↛ B, Worker A ↛ B).
- Specific fixes: S1 remove/admin-gate `GET /users`; S5 worker job lists limited to matched/assigned jobs; S11 public worker endpoints return a `PublicProfessionalDto` (no email/phone/address); S3 delete the emergency broadcast; S4 remove generic job PATCH/PUT (transitions come in Phase 4/5); S7/S12 ownership/participant checks; S8 review creation disabled until Phase 9's verified version.
- **WebSocket auth:** JWT in handshake, server-side user lookup, no client-supplied IDs, CORS from config, rooms server-assigned (full event model in Phase 6).
- **Mobile:** delete the mock-login fallback and `@example.com` shortcut (S9); remove demo chips; errors shown inline.
- **Errors & logging:** register a global exception filter producing `{ success:false, error:{ code, message, details, requestId } }`; Pino logger with request ID middleware (header `x-request-id` propagated); redact secrets/OTP/password/phone; disable Swagger in production (or protect it).
- **Audit:** `AuditLog` table + `AuditService.record()`; used by admin actions, verification, role changes, refunds.
- **AI hardening (minimal):** safety screen fails **closed** (unknown → treat as needs-review), errors return error codes not fake content, user text passed as data not instructions, per-user AI rate limit.
- **Exit:** a scripted authorization test suite (every endpoint × other-user/other-role) passes; no `any` in API controllers (lint rule); security headers verified.

### Phase 2 — Identity: phone + password, sign-up, country config (≈ 1.5–2 weeks)

**Goal:** R6, R7, R8 complete. Real accounts only.

- **Backend:**
  - Migrations: `User.phone/phoneVerifiedAt/countryCode/locale/timezone/status`, optional email, `Session`, `PhoneVerification`, `CountryConfig`, `CustomerProfile`, `Professional.status (ONBOARDING|PENDING_REVIEW|ACTIVE|SUSPENDED|REJECTED)`.
  - `CountryConfigService` + `GET /config/countries`, `GET /config/country/:code`, `GET /config/geo`; seed **Pakistan** (and the other pilot countries as disabled) from doc 22 §11.5.
  - `OtpProvider` interface with `WhatsAppProvider` / `SmsProvider` adapters chosen per country config; dev adapter logs codes to the API console **only when `NODE_ENV=development`** (no hard-coded codes).
  - Endpoints: `POST /auth/phone/start`, `POST /auth/phone/verify`, `POST /auth/signup`, `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/refresh` (rotation + reuse detection), `POST /auth/logout`, `GET /auth/sessions`, `DELETE /auth/sessions/:id`, `POST /auth/password/forgot`, `POST /auth/password/reset`, `POST /auth/password/change`, `GET /me`.
  - Password hashing with argon2id (or bcrypt cost 12); access token 15 min, refresh 30 days rotated, hashed at rest, bound to `deviceId`.
  - Admin login separate: `POST /admin/v1/auth/login` (email + password + TOTP).
- **Shared:** `packages/shared/src/phone.ts` (parse/format/validate via `libphonenumber-js`), zod schemas for signup/login, `CountryConfig` type.
- **Mobile:**
  - `PhoneField`, `PasswordField`, `OtpField`, `CountryPicker` components (§C.6).
  - Screens: Welcome/Language, Login, Sign-up role, customer sign-up steps, worker sign-up steps 1–3 (account creation; worker onboarding steps continue in Phase 3), Forgot/Reset password.
  - `authSlice` rewritten: real login/signup, secure token storage, refresh-on-401 interceptor in `services/api.ts`, `restoreSession` on boot (splash held until resolved), logout revokes the session server-side.
  - Remove `otp.tsx` fake logic and the email login screen.
- **Exit:** new customer and new worker can sign up on a real device with a real code, log out, log in with phone + password, reset password; country auto-detected with masking correct for PK/IN/AE/SA/BD numbers; brute-force throttled; session restore works after app kill.

### Phase 3 — Profiles, media storage, catalog from DB (≈ 2 weeks)

**Goal:** R5 complete; R1 for profile/catalog data.

- **Object storage:** S3-compatible (MinIO in docker-compose for dev, R2/S3 in prod). `POST /uploads/presign {purpose, mime, size}` → signed PUT; server validates purpose, size, MIME and magic bytes on finalize; private buckets for verification docs; signed GET URLs with short TTL; image thumbnails via a worker job.
- **Customer profile:** `GET/PATCH /me`, avatar upload, language, notification preferences, addresses CRUD with GPS pin + reverse geocode (`Geocoder` adapter: Google/Mapbox), default address, trusted contacts CRUD. Screens: Account (real values), Edit profile, Addresses list/edit, Notification settings, Appearance (Light/Dark/Auto stored on device + `uiSlice`), Language.
- **Worker profile & onboarding:** remaining worker sign-up steps (skills, area, hours, pricing, ID docs, selfie) with resumable progress; `GET/PATCH /professionals/me`, `PUT /professionals/me/services`, `PUT /professionals/me/hours`, `PUT /professionals/me/area`, portfolio CRUD, `GET/POST /professionals/me/verification`. Screens: Worker Account (real values), Edit profile, Skills, Service area, Working hours, Pricing, Portfolio, Verification docs (wire `DocumentVerification` to real uploads; OCR is a later enhancement, never auto-saves).
- **Public worker profile:** `GET /professionals/:id` → photo (or initials if hidden), name, verified badges (from approved `VerificationCase` only, each with meaning + date), skills, years, languages, rating, job count, reviews (paginated), portfolio. Screen used from offers and job screen.
- **Catalog:** migrate categories/services/issues/price bands into DB with translations; seed real Pakistan launch categories (doc 22 §11.5 top tiles) through a migration-safe seed; `GET /catalog/categories`, `/catalog/categories/:id`, `/catalog/estimate`. Home tiles and Category screen read from the API (cached, offline-capable); remove `CATEGORIES` constants from runtime use.
- **Admin minimum (unblocks workers):** admin login + Verifications page wired to `/admin/v1/verification-cases` with document viewer, approve / reject / request info → `verification.updated` + audit (full admin in Phase 11).
- **Exit:** every Account/profile screen shows only DB data; a worker completes onboarding, an admin approves them in the admin portal, and the worker's status flips to Active in the app.

### Phase 4 — Request → job, AI gateway, state machine (≈ 1.5 weeks)

**Goal:** a customer creates a real job with real address, media and AI analysis.

- **Backend:** `Job`, `JobMedia`, `JobAiAnalysis`, `JobEvent` migrations; `JobStateMachine`; `POST /jobs` (DRAFT→SUBMITTED, idempotency key), `GET /jobs?scope&cursor`, `GET /jobs/:id` (role-shaped DTOs: exact address hidden from workers until booked), `POST /jobs/:id/cancel`.
- **AI gateway:** `AIProvider` interface → `GeminiProvider`; strict JSON schema (zod) validated output; prompt/schema versions; stores `JobAiAnalysis`; timeout + retry + fallback ("we couldn't analyse; pick a category"); category returned as catalog **code**, mapped server-side; `SpeechToText` interface for `/ai/transcribe` with real recording in `VoiceField` (`expo-audio`), audio stored as `JobMedia(AUDIO)`.
- **Mobile request flow:** categories/issues from catalog; "Where?" uses saved addresses + GPS (permission explainer, denial fallback to manual pin); photos uploaded via presign (compressed ≤ 300 KB); estimate from `/catalog/estimate` in country currency (`PriceText`, minor units); submit → navigate to the **Job screen** (fixes the dead end); draft autosave via `useDraft`; offline: queue in outbox and show "Saved, will send when online".
- **Customer Job screen & My Jobs:** real data, timeline from `JobEvent`s, cancel with reason; remove all MOCK/DEV TOOLS code.
- **Exit:** request created on device appears in DB with media in storage and an analysis row; My Jobs and Job screen show it; no placeholder strings remain in the customer request path.

### Phase 5 — Matching, offers, booking, worker job feed (≈ 2 weeks)

**Goal:** customer gets real offers from real nearby workers and books one.

- **Matching:** PostGIS query — active + verified + online + offers the service + within radius of job location + working now (for ASAP) + gender preference (doc 22 §11.4) → rank (distance, rating quality, response rate, fairness) → top N `JobMatch` rows → `job.request` event + push to each; expiry job re-matches or moves to EXPIRED. Never rank on stars alone (doc 04 F).
- **Offers:** `POST /jobs/:id/offers` (worker price, ETA, note), `DELETE /offers/:id`, `POST /jobs/:id/decline`, offer TTL (config, default 10 min) with countdown; customer `POST /offers/:id/accept` → transaction: lock job row, verify status OFFERS_READY + offer pending + worker still available → create `Booking`, reject other offers, create `Conversation`, emit events. Race-tested.
- **Worker online/offline:** `POST /professionals/me/online|offline` persisted, auto-offline after inactivity; Today screen toggle real.
- **Worker screens:** Today (next booking, today's earnings, requests from API), Jobs tabs New/Booked/Done from API, request card shows area + distance only (no exact address), Send price sheet (AmountField with suggested chips from price band, soft warnings), Decline with reasons.
- **Customer:** offers section on Job screen with real `WorkerCard`s (photo/initials, verified, rating, jobs, distance, ETA, price) → public profile → Choose.
- **Exit:** two real devices (customer + worker) complete request → offer → booking; double-accept and accept-after-expiry are rejected; worker never sees the exact address before booking.

### Phase 6 — Realtime platform & notifications (≈ 1.5 weeks)

**Goal:** R3 complete.

- Implement §C.3: `/rt` namespace, JWT handshake, Redis adapter, rooms, event envelope, `EventBus` in API so every state-machine side effect publishes once.
- `Notification` table, `NotificationService` (persist → socket → push fallback), templates per locale, de-duplication, channel preferences honoured; `GET /notifications`, `POST /notifications/read`, `GET /notifications/unread-count`; `GET /sync?since=`.
- Push: `expo-notifications` (permission asked after first booking or first job request with an explainer), token registered on the session, Android channels, deep links (`fixli://jobs/:id`, `fixli://chat/:id`) open the right screen, EAS credentials.
- Mobile `RealtimeProvider`: connect on login, reconnect with backoff, backfill on reconnect/foreground, dispatch into store; Notifications screen; bell and tab badges.
- Live job updates on both Job screens and lists without pull-to-refresh.
- **Exit:** with the app foregrounded, backgrounded and killed, each event in §C.3 reaches the right user only (verified with a third unrelated account that receives nothing); duplicates are not shown.

### Phase 7 — Real-time chat (≈ 1–1.5 weeks)

**Goal:** R4 complete.

- **Backend:** `Conversation`/`Message`/`MessageRead` migrations; conversation auto-created on booking (also allowed pre-booking between customer and an offering worker if owner wants — default off); `GET /conversations?cursor`, `GET /conversations/:id/messages?cursor&before`, `POST /conversations/:id/messages` (idempotent via `clientId`), `POST /conversations/:id/read`; socket `message.created`, `message.read`, `typing` (throttled); image messages via presign; system messages for job events ("Ahmed is on the way"); phone/URL detection with a gentle warning (doc 04 L); report/block; conversation becomes read-only some days after completion (config).
- **Mobile:** Messages tab (list with last message, unread count, job title, counterpart photo), Thread screen (inverted virtualised list, optimistic send with pending/sent/read ticks, retry on failure, offline outbox, image picker, typing indicator, date separators, keyboard handling, RTL), entry from Job screen "Message" button; push opens the thread.
- **Exit:** two devices chat in real time, messages persist across reinstall, read receipts and unread badges correct, offline messages send on reconnect exactly once.

### Phase 8 — Job execution, live tracking, evidence, change orders (≈ 1.5–2 weeks)

**Goal:** the on-site part of the loop works for real.

- **Transitions:** `POST /bookings/:id/en-route|arrive|start|finish` (worker), `POST /bookings/:id/confirm` (customer) with preconditions (before photo at start, after photo at finish); "Arrived" suggested by geofence with drift tolerance.
- **Live location:** worker app sends location only in `EN_ROUTE` (foreground; background only with explicit disclosure), server forwards to `job:{id}` customer only and stores minimal history per retention policy; ETA from a `Routing` adapter (server-side), not a constant. Remove the global always-on customer location watcher.
- **Evidence:** camera-first before/after capture, background upload with retry, shown on both sides.
- **Change orders:** `POST /bookings/:id/change-orders` (items, reason, photos, new total) → customer sheet Approve/Decline → total recomputed in minor units; no silent charges.
- **Masked calling:** "Call" uses a provider number proxy where configured, else shows the number only after booking and only during the job (owner decision; default: in-app chat + dial after booking).
- **Exit:** a full on-site sequence on two devices with live map, photos and one change order; illegal transitions rejected server-side.

### Phase 9 — Payments (cash first), earnings, reviews, disputes (≈ 2 weeks)

**Goal:** money and reputation are real and consistent.

- **Cash flow (doc 22 §11.8):** worker "Mark cash received {amount}" → customer one-tap confirm (auto-confirm after timeout with flag) → `Payment CONFIRMED` → commission `LedgerEntry` (rates from country config) → balance with soft/hard limits that pause new requests; disagreements open a dispute.
- `PaymentProvider` interface ready for card/wallet (JazzCash/Easypaisa/Stripe) with webhook signature verification + idempotency — implementation gated on legal L5.
- **Earnings:** `GET /professionals/me/earnings` and ledger (paginated); Earnings screen with real week/month totals, per-job list, commission owed card, settle-up instructions; Today's earnings real.
- **Reviews:** `POST /bookings/:id/review` only after COMPLETED, one per side, rating 1–5, tags, optional text; stats recomputed in a transaction; reviews on public profile; moderation flag.
- **Disputes:** `POST /bookings/:id/disputes` with category + evidence, holds settlement, admin resolution with audit; parties see status updates live.
- **Rebook / favourites / history:** "Book again" prefills category/issue/address; favourite workers; past jobs with evidence and receipt.
- **Exit:** ledger reconciles to payments for a scripted set of jobs; duplicate confirm/mark requests are idempotent; reviews impossible without a completed booking.

### Phase 10 — Safety & SOS (≈ 1 week)

- SOS screen per doc 22 §5.1: press-and-hold → 5 s cancellable countdown → emergency type (Water/Pipe burst · Electric/Fire hazard · Gas smell · Life-threatening) → **life-threatening shows the local emergency numbers from country config with a call button and never dispatches a worker**; property emergencies create an urgent job with auto-dispatch to the nearest verified worker, then offers fallback (doc 22 D2).
- Trusted-contact notification (SMS/WhatsApp), `Incident` records, in-job SOS for both roles, "Report a problem", block user.
- Safety copy reviewed (legal L10); no claim that Fixli contacted authorities.
- **Exit:** SOS works with no payment method and no subscription; emergency numbers come from config; incidents appear in the admin safety console (Phase 11).

### Phase 11 — Admin portal on real data (≈ 2 weeks)

- Admin auth (email + password + TOTP), RBAC roles from doc 12 (Super Admin, Operations, Verification, Support, Safety, Finance, Content, Analytics, Auditor), all endpoints under `/admin/v1` with role guards and audit.
- Pages: Dashboard (real KPIs from DB: active users, online workers, jobs by status, fill rate, cancellations, disputes, GMV in PKR), Users (search by phone/name, view, suspend), Professionals & Verification queue (document viewer with signed URLs, approve/reject/request info, expiry), Jobs (live list, timeline, reassign, cancel), Disputes (evidence, chat transcript, resolution, ledger adjustment), Payments & ledger, Catalog & price bands & translations, Country config editor (versioned), Safety console, Reviews moderation, Audit log viewer, Feature flags.
- Realtime admin feed (`admin:{role}` rooms) for new verifications, disputes and incidents. Remove all dummy fallbacks; API base URL from env.
- Apply doc 22 Phase 7 visual alignment (tokens, light/dark, logo).
- **Exit:** every admin page reads/writes the DB; every admin mutation is in the audit log; a Verification-role admin cannot access Finance pages.

### Phase 12 — Localisation, accessibility, offline, analytics, performance (≈ 1.5 weeks)

- Every user-facing string through `t()` (CI check for JSX literals); Urdu + Arabic translations reviewed by native speakers; fix `app.name`; RTL pass on every screen; Intl number/date/currency per locale.
- Accessibility: labels/roles on every touchable, 48/56 pt targets, Dynamic Type to 200 %, contrast ≥ 4.5:1, reduce motion, VoiceOver/TalkBack on both full loops.
- Offline: persisted outbox for requests, status events, evidence, messages; cached catalog, today's jobs and last job states; clear sync state UI.
- Analytics (doc 16 + doc 22 §8.5) through a privacy-safe `Analytics` adapter (no addresses, phones or message text).
- Performance: virtualised lists, `expo-image` caching, thumbnails, bundle audit, cold start < 2.5 s on a low-end Android.
- **Exit:** doc 22 Phase 6 checklist passes; usability round with real users in Pakistan.

### Phase 13 — Hardening & release (≈ 1.5 weeks)

- Load tests (auth, matching, chat, socket fan-out), resilience tests (DB/Redis/AI/OTP outage, duplicate requests), backups + restore drill, monitoring/alerts/error tracking (Sentry for mobile + API), staging environment with production parity, migration rollback runbook.
- E2E: Maestro (or Detox) flows for customer signup→review, worker signup→payout, admin verification→dispute→audit, run in CI on emulators.
- Security: SAST, dependency scan, secret scan, authorization test suite, penetration test.
- Store readiness: privacy policy, terms (Urdu/English), account deletion, data-safety labels, permission strings, screenshots, EAS production builds, OTA update channel.
- Re-run this audit (doc 21 §30); target ≥ 90 % with no P0/P1 open.
- **Exit:** doc 20 release checklist complete for Pakistan; owner sign-off.

| | **Total** | | **≈ 20–23 weeks for one developer** |

Phases 6 and 7 can run in parallel with 8 once Phase 5 is done; Phase 11's verification page is pulled forward into Phase 3 because workers cannot be approved without it.

### Open questions for the owner

1. D11 brand: Fixli or Triply?
2. D9: confirm a one-time code at sign-up and reset (recommended), WhatsApp first for Pakistan?
3. Chat before booking (customer ↔ offering worker) — allowed or booking-only (default)?
4. Calling: provider number masking at launch, or show the number after booking?
5. Commission and cash limits for Pakistan (doc 22 §11.8 placeholders).
6. Hosting region / processors for SMS, speech-to-text, maps (legal L4).

## Implementation status (updated 2026-10-07)

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 Repo integrity & tooling | **Done, 2 checks pending** | Dockerfile image build and CI run not yet verified (Docker Desktop hung on a full disk). Typecheck, tests, baseline migration and env validation verified. API has no ESLint config yet. |
| 1 Security foundation | **Done (API + mobile)** | S1–S12 closed. 110 API unit tests + 37 e2e authorization tests (real Postgres) + 44 mobile tests pass. Not yet done from the Phase 1 list: Redis-backed rate-limit store (in-memory today, Phase 6), Pino logger (Nest logger + request IDs today), AI per-user (not per-IP) limit, lint rule banning `any` bodies. |
| 2 Phone + password identity | **Done, without the one-time code (deferred by owner)** | Phone + password login and signup for customers and workers; country-aware masked phone field (PK/IN/AE/SA/BD data, only PK open); sessions with 15-min access tokens and rotating hashed refresh tokens with reuse detection; logout/revoke/change-password; staff email login. 127 API unit + 43 e2e + 25 shared + 63 mobile tests. Not in Phase 2 (deferred): OTP/phone verification, password reset (needs the code), staff TOTP, worker onboarding steps (Phase 3), forgot-password UI. **Known gap until OTP exists:** anyone can register a number they don't own, and signup reveals whether a number is registered. |
| 3 Profiles, storage, catalog, admin verification | **Done (backend verified; mobile verified by tests + bundling, not yet by running on a device)** | Direct-to-storage uploads (local disk dev / S3 prod) with server-side size and real-file-type checks; avatars and portfolio public, ID documents private with signed, expiring, audited links. Customer profile + addresses (GPS, landmark). Worker profile, skills, area, hours, pricing, portfolio, ID + selfie, onboarding checklist, submit-for-review, admin approve/reject/ask-again, auto-activation, public profile with dated badges and hide-photo option. Real 10-category launch catalogue (en/ur/ar, drafts for native review) served from DB. Admin portal: real login, dashboard counts, verification review, disputes, catalogue; no dummy data. 162 API unit + 71 e2e + 25 shared + 72 mobile tests. **Still mock/placeholder (their own phases):** customer request flow (`request-service.tsx`: hard-coded addresses and price range, no real offers/matching: Phase 4/5), payments and earnings (Phase 9), chat (Phase 7), notifications (Phase 6). Placeholder Chat tabs were removed. |
| 4 Request → job, AI gateway, timeline | **Done (backend verified; app verified by tests + bundling, not yet on a device)** | Request flow on real data: catalogue category + common problems, hold-to-talk voice note (expo-audio) transcribed server-side and editable, up to 4 photos, Now/Today/Tomorrow/day+slot (computed in the customer's timezone), saved address. Draft autosave; idempotent send (retry-safe). AI behind an `AiProvider` interface (Gemini adapter, model via `GEMINI_MODEL`): output validated against the real catalogue, every call recorded (model, prompt/schema version, validity, latency), one retry, graceful "unavailable". Deterministic hazard rules (en/ur/Roman Urdu) show local emergency numbers even with AI down. Job stores an address snapshot; workers see area/city only until booked; job photos/voice private with signed links. Every state change writes a timeline event; cancel records a reason. 194 API unit + 89 e2e + 25 shared + 62 mobile tests. **Not in Phase 4:** price estimates (needs owner-approved price bands per city), offline outbox (the draft is kept and re-send is safe, but nothing auto-sends when the connection returns), matching/offers (Phase 5). |
| 5 Matching, offers, booking | **Done (backend verified; app verified by tests + bundling, not yet on a device)** | Matching in the database: approved, online, active account, right skill, within the worker's own radius (great-circle distance with an indexed bounding box; city fallback when the address has no GPS), working hours in the worker's timezone; ranked 60% closeness / 40% review-weighted rating. Top 10 notified (socket event; push in Phase 6), every match stored with rank, score and distance. Workers only see requests sent to them. Offers: send/revise/withdraw/"not for me", 10-minute expiry, customer sees the best 3. Accepting books the job at that price atomically; a row lock on the worker blocks double-booking for overlapping times. Background sweeper (advisory-locked, safe on many instances) expires offers, retries unmatched requests and widens the search once after 15 min. All numbers are configuration (O3). 207 API unit + 104 e2e + 25 shared + 63 mobile tests. **Not in Phase 5:** SOS auto-dispatch to the nearest worker (Phase 10), push notifications and live updates instead of 15-second refresh (Phase 6), PostGIS (current SQL is fine at pilot scale). |
